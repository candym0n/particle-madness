# Particle Madness
Particle Madness is an independant art project for the Art + Artist unit of our art class.

# Why did I make this?
I wanted to build on the fundamental ideas presented by Conway's Game of Life by adding my own twist to it - identity. This project shows how, over time, particles can either seperate into distinct cliques or mix together to one uniform group.

# A challenge that I faced
During this project, I often faced the challenge of the particles either always seperating into groups and never going back or always blending together immediately. I fixed this issue by introducing a "diversity" paramater that ranges between 0 and 100 instead of just staying fixed at 0 or 100.
